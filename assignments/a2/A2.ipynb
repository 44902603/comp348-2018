Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.\",\n",

    "4. Evaluation of the results and comparison with the previous classifiers. What system is best and why?\n",
    "5. Explain what further changes would possibly improve the classifier and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this information should be inserted in this notebook below this question. The information should be structured in sections and it must be clear and precise. The explanations should be convincing. Below is a possible list of section headings. These sections are just a guideline. Feel free to change them, but make sure that they are informative and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Note that, even if the new system might not obtain better results than the previous systems, you can obtain top marks if you perform a good error analysis of the initial systems and the final system and you give a sensible justification of the decisions that led you to implement the new system. Similarly, you may not obtain top marks if you present a system that improves on the results but you do not provide a good error analysis or you do not justify your choice of new system. **"
